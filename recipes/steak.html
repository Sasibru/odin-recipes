            Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, 
            broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinades 
            wonderfully, and really can be substituted for 
            any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time 
            to trim it well.</p>

        <h3 class="center">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
            <li>â…” cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="center">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><strong>Step one</strong>: Remove all silver skin and extra fat from 
                the steak. Carefully cut out the connective 
                tissue that connects the 2 halves of the 
                steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces. 
                Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece 
                that is slightly separated from the larger 
                half). Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 
                2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Step two</strong>: Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified 
                butter when pan is hot, then place the 
                steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. 
                Cook until browned on all sides, firm, and 
                reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted into the center should 
                read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of 
                about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort 
                of triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) 
                Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let 
                steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to 130 
                degrees F.</li>
            <li><strong>Step three</strong>: Pour stock into skillet set over medium 
                heat. Stir with a wooden spoon scraping 
                up the browned bits from the bottom. When 
                brownings dissolve and liquid begins to 
                reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat 
                to low. Add accumulated juices from the 
                meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter chunks. 
                Cook and stir until butter melts. If liquid 
                has reduced too much, add a splash of broth. 
                Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Step four</strong>: To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan 
                sauce over them.</li>
        </ol>
