        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, 
            broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinades 
            wonderfully, and really can be substituted for 
            any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time 
            to trim it well.</p>
