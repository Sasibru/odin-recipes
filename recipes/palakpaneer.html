        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt ghee in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir in garlic and 
                cumin seed; cook until the garlic softens, about 3 minutes. Add 
                tomato paste, ginger, 1 teaspoon garam masala, salt, onion, and 
                water. Increase heat to medium, and stir until the tomato paste 
                dissolves. Simmer slowly for 1 hour, adding water as needed to 
                maintain a sauce-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Stir in spinach and cook until hot, about 5 minutes. Add paneer, 
                and allow to cook an additional 5 minutes, or until hot. Pour into 
                a serving dish and sprinkle with cilantro and remaining 1 teaspoon 
                garam masala.</li>
        </ol>
